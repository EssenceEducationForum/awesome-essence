Essence, an OMG Standard, delivers essential, universal elements found in all Software Engineering (SE) endeavours and a language to describe and extend these elements and their use in concrete practices to tailor SE methods to teams' needs. Its Kernel separates the stable What and Why from the more adaptable How. That way, it provides an essential thinking framework facilitating the adoption and customization of practices and methods. As such, it supports multiple ways of educating SE students as well as training practitioners for the future. The first deployments of Essence in industry and academic courses around the globe show promising results. But since it is an entirely new way to think about SE practices, methods, and their building blocks—it requires some effort and thought to dive into the standard. This workshop facilitates the adoption by sharing experiences, best practices, and lessons learned.},

  abstract         = {This is the story of a small group of people who set out to change the world of software engineering.  The initiative became known as {SEMAT} which stands for Software Engineering Method and Theory. {SEMAT} refers to the community of volunteers that developed a new framework referred to as Essence. The initiative was started by Ivar Jacobson, Bertrand Meyer and Richard Soley primarily to address repeating problems observed within the software industry, but its value extends beyond just software as you will learn from this story.   The story begins with the initial {SEMAT} meeting which occurred in Zurich, Switzerland in March, 2010, and is told from the personal perspective of one of the participants who subsequently became deeply involved in the initiative over the following ten years. There are multiple reasons why I wrote this book. First, this book is a compilation of stories from my personal notes intended to provide insight into the motivation, challenges and thinking behind Essence. Second, I share with the reader information about some of the principle people who structured and influenced the {SEMAT} effort. Third, I share reflections on events that shaped the evolution of my thinking on this journey.In its simplest form Essence can be thought of as a thinking framework-- or a mental model practitioners can keep in their head to guide their daily decisions.   Prior knowledge of {SEMAT} and Essence is not required to understand the stories in this book. However, for those interested in learning more, references are provided in Chapter Seven.The intended audience for this book is information technology professionals including software developers, testers, systems engineers, analysts, project and organizational managers/leaders, support personnel and those involved in education and research. The title of this book was chosen based on a phrase Ivar Jacobson often used when conversing with the author during our many meetings which occurred between 2010 and 2019.When I started to write this book I did not know exactly where the story would go. One of the reviewers of this book observed that I spoke a great deal about the significance of emotion throughout the book. The cover of the book showing a runner handing the baton to a teammate was chosen because it is a critical moment in track that is essential to a relay team being successful. The stories in this book reflect the author's recollection of events. Some names, locations, and identifying characteristics have been changed to protect the privacy of those depicted.  Dialogue has been re-created from memory. Essence was adopted as an official Object Management Group ({OMG}) standard in June, 2014. The mission of the {OMG} is to provide technology standards that provide real-world value. What people are saying about "Shy Boys""A fascinating retelling of one man's journey to become part of an ongoing and never-ending revolution in software engineering. The stories of the people, places, and ideas involved in the revolution are coherent and interesting, especially some of the big personalities who were involved, or refused to be involved. This serves not only as a warning for those trying to start a revolution in their chosen field, but also as lighter fluid to get the fires burning."

It is by far the most-used practice when developing software, and it has been generalized to be applicable for not just software but all kinds of products. It has been taught to millions of developers, all based on the Scrum Guide. Today all our Scrum training is accompanied by a set of cards designed using the Essence standard, which has given us a better Scrum.},

Then, he will play a series of games with these cards, which help teams to make their application of Scrum significantly more successful. You will discover that these cards are unique: They describe the essence of the complete Scrum Guide on just 21 poker-sized cards. The same set of cards be used to play a very large number of engaging games; in the video Brian demonstrates that by playing four great games. The cards reliance on Essence allows teams to compose different practices into complete methods, for example the team can select Scrum, User Stories, Test-Driven Development, and Pair Programing from a library of practices and create their own method. This video is also a more human presentation of the {ACM} Queue article: ‘Scrum Essentials Cards – Experiences of Scrum Teams Improving with Essence’ by Jeff Sutherland, Ivar Jacobson and Brian Kerr. https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3418775.
